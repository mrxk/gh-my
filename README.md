This plugin reads a JSON file from `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/gh-my/config.json`. If

used. This JSON file contains a single object with the following fields (all are
optional).

* `includeClosed`: Bool. When true, closed PRs are included by default.
* `includeDrafts`: Bool. When true, draft PRs are included by default.
* `repositories`: String array. The listed repositories will be queried for the
  `all` view.
* `defaultView`: String array. The listed columns will be included in the
  default view. Default [ "checks", "mergeable", "approved", "title", "author",
  "repository", "change", "updatedAt" ].
* `wideView`: String array. The listed columns will be included in the wide
  view. Default [ "checks", "mergeable", "approved", "draft", "title", "url",
  "author", "repository", "change", "state", "comments", "updatedAt" ].

Valid view columns include the following:
* approved
* author
* change
